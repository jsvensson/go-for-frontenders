# Go for Frontenders

This is a simple example in Go of a basic REST API with a data store repository. It's very much WIP,
and not intended as a great example of 100% idiomatic Go or best practices -- it is an example
project used for a workshop aimed at frontend developers interested in Go for backend development.

Caveat lector.
